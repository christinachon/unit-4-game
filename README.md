# unit-4-game

This is my game for University of Washington Coding Bootcamp - Week 4.

The game starts automatically when you load the page. A target number is randomly generated.

Click one of the mushrooms to find out it's hidden value, you will see it add into "Your Score"

Try to get your score the same as the target score to win! Be careful - if it goes over, then you lose!

A new game starts automatically after each win and loss.

Enjoy!
